	<li>The eighth largest metropolises in India, Pune is located in the state of Maharashtra. It is the second largest city in the state after Mumbai, and is an important city in terms of its economical and industrial growth. Once the hometown of Marathas and a centre of power for the Maratha Empire, the presence of the numerous edifices in Pune links to its rich and glorious past. The city leads as the ‘veritable heartland’ of cultural Maharashtra. Pune also has made its mark as the educational epicenter winning itself the sobriquet, ‘The Oxford of the East’. Not just that, it has a growing industrial hinterland, with information technology, engineering and automotive companies sprouting. The city is known for cultural activities like classical music, spirituality, theatre, sports, and literature. Pune is a pleasant travel getaway destination to spend a quiet holiday.</li>
